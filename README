- LICENCE
  see COPYING.
  and see lighttpd LICENCE.

- issues
  1. Can not set allowed Origin in a configuration file.
     This causes security issue on the Internet.
  2. Can not use Websocket-Protocol.
     So, you can not use a WebSocket API like below.
     var ws = new WebSocket("ws://example.com", "sub_proto");
  3. not handle UTF-8 encoding.
     please use UTF-8 or encodeURIComponent() in javascript and
     server-side Applications.
